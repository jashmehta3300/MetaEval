1_1909.07557 = This paper studies the assignment problem in the Housing Market setting , where each agent can only receive one single object and each agent has preferences over objects . Each agent has a preference list of all objects and the agents are embedded in a social network which determines their ability to exchange their objects . Two agents may swap their items under two conditions : they are neighbors in the social network , and they find it mutually profitable ( or no one will become worse under weak preferences ) . The paper shows that the problem is polynomial-time solvable in general graphs and NP-hard in star-structures and complete graphs . The authors also show the NP-Hardness of Object Reachability in complete graphs , which can be modified to show the general case where the agent is an endpoint ( a leaf ) in the general path and left it unsolved . The problem is interesting and the paper is well-written . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . In the paper , there are two different preference sets for agents . One is strict , which is a full ordinal list of objects , and the other one is weak , where agents are allowed to be indifferent between objects . Both preference sets have been widely studied . In this paper , the authors only study the two preference sets from different aspects . 2 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , it is hard to follow the proof of Theorem 3.1 . 3 .In Theorem 4.1 , the proof is not easy to follow . 4 .The proof of theorem 4.2 is not clear . 5 .In the proof , the inequality in Theorem 5.1 is not correct . 6 .In theorem 5.2 , there is a typo in the last line .
