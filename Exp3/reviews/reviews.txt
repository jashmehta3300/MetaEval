1_2012.04715 = In this paper , the authors study the problem of finding a projective plane of order 10 from projective geometry . The authors translate the problem into Boolean logic and use satisfiability ( SAT ) solvers to produce nonexistence certificates that can be verified by a third party . The paper is well written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main contribution of this paper is to use SAT solvers instead of special-purpose search code to solve the problem . The reason is that using well-tested SAT solver is less error-prone than writing special purpose search code . But it is not clear to me how to verify the existence certificates of the proposed method . 2 .The authors should provide more details about the algorithm . For example , how many blocks are used in the proposed algorithm ? 3 .In the proof of Theorem 2.1 , how is the number of blocks selected ? 4 .In Theorem 3.2 , how do the authors choose the order of the blocks ? 5 .The proof of Proposition 3.3 is not very clear . It is not easy to understand the proof . 6 .In Proposition 3 , how to choose the block size ? 7 .How to select the blocks in Theorem 4.1 ?
1_1810.00826 = This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks ( GNNs ) in the context of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test . In particular , the paper shows that the most powerful GNN , Graph Isomorphism Network ( GIN ) , has high representational power as it almost perfectly fits the training data , whereas GNN variants often severely underfit the data . The paper then proposes a simple architecture , GraphSAGE , that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNN . The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of graph classification tasks . The main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for analyzing GNN ’ s expressive power to capture different graph structures . However , I have the following concerns about this paper . 1 .The paper claims that GNN can represent injective multiset functions , however , it is not clear to me how to interpret this statement . For example , in Eq . ( 5.1 ) , the authors claim that h ( c , X ) = ( 1 + ) + f ( c ) + \sum_ { x } _ { f ( x ) } is unique for each pair ( c,X ) , where c and X are multisets of bounded size . But in the proof of Theorem 3.1 , it seems to me that for infinitely many choices of f , including all irrational numbers , the function f is not unique . 2 .In the experimental results , the performance of the proposed GIN is not better than other GNN models . In Table 1 , the results of GCN ( Hamilton et al. , 2017 ) is better than the proposed one . It is not convincing to me why the proposed method is superior to GCN . 3 .In Table 2 , the result of GIN with 1-layer perceptrons are better than GCN with 2-layer in terms of classification accuracy . It seems that GCN has better classification accuracy than GIN . It would be better if the authors can provide more explanation about this result . 4 .In Section 5.2 , the author claimed that GIN can not learn to distinguish simple graph structures , which is not true . The authors should provide more explanations about this claim .
1_1907.07355 = This paper studies the effect of spurious statistical cues on BERT 's performance on the argument reasoning comprehension task . The authors show that a range of models all exploit these cues , and propose an adversarial dataset on which all models achieve random accuracy . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of this paper is to show that the BERT performance is entirely accounted for by exploitation of spurious statistics in the dataset . This is an interesting result . However , I have some concerns about this paper . 1 .The authors claim that BERT ’ s performance is only three points below the average untrained human baseline , which is surprising . It is not clear to me how this result can be explained by the spurious statistics . 2 .In the experiments , the authors only consider unigrams and bigrams , although more sophisticated cues may be present . It would be interesting to see the results of more complex cues , such as bigrams . 3 .In Table 1 , it would be better if the authors can report the mean and median performance of BERT . 4 .In Figure 1 , the error bars are too small . It will be better to show the average error bars . 5 .In Section 3.2 , it is unclear to me why the authors did not include the results in Table 1 .
1_1904.11943 = This paper proposes SWALP , an approach to low precision training that averages low precision SGD iterates with a modified learning rate schedule . The authors show that it can match the performance of full-precision SGD even with all numbers quantized down to 8 bits , including the gradient accumulators . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The proposed method is novel and interesting . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . It is not clear to me why SWA is better than HALP . HALP is a variant of SGD that has the ability to produce arbitrarily close solutions to the optimal solution for quadratic objectives , and to a noise ball asymptotically smaller than the low precision one in strongly convex settings . 2 .In the experiments , the authors only compare SWA with HALP on CIFAR-10/100 and ResNet-164 . It would be more convincing if the authors can compare with other state-of-the-art methods such as QSGD and ZipML . 3 .In Section 4.2 , it would be better to explain why the variance of these samples always satisfies E [ \sigma_2 ] > 0 .
1_1902.04911 = This paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for dialogue generation with knowledge-grounded responses . The authors propose a knowledge selection mechanism where both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge are used to facilitate knowledge selection . Experiments on both automatic and human evaluation verify the superiority of the proposed model over previous baselines . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns . 1 .The authors claim that their model is the first neural model which incorporates the posterior distribution as guidance , enabling accurate knowledge lookups and high quality response generation . But , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , the prior distribution p ( k|x ) is inferred from both utterances and responses , and it ensures the appropriate selection of knowledge during the training process . Meanwhile , a prior distribution is inferred only from utterances only , so that appropriate knowledge can be selected even without responses during the inference process . Compared with the previous work , our model can better incorporate appropriate knowledge in response generation , which is better than previous work . 2 .In Table 1 , the authors compare the performance of their model with Seq2Seq model with a GRU decoder where knowledge is concatenated . It would be better if the authors can show the results of different ways of incorporating knowledge incorporating knowledge . 3 .It is better to show the effect of different loss functions in Table 1 .
1_2005.06628 = This paper proposes a pruning approach to reduce the number of parameters in the BERT model . Specifically , the pruning is done by pruning the architecture design dimensions of the encoder and decoding layers . The paper is well written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns about this paper : 1 . It is not clear to me how the proposed pruning method is different from other pruning methods such as attention pruning . 2 .The proposed method is not compared with other pruned models such as DistilBERT ( Sanh et al. , 2019 ) . 3 .The experiments are only conducted on MNLI task . It would be better to conduct experiments on other NLP tasks such as SQuAD and other language modeling tasks . 4 .The paper is not well organized . For example , in the introduction , the authors claim that the proposed method can be applied towards other objectives such as FLOPs or latency . But in the experiments , it is only compared with BERT with three encoder layers .
1_2102.07983 = This paper introduces a new low-shot WSD dataset , FEWS ( Few-shot Examples of Word Senses ) , a new dataset automatically extracted from example sentences in Wiktionary . The dataset has high sense coverage across different natural language domains and provides : ( 1 ) a large training set that covers many more senses than previous datasets and ( 2 ) a comprehensive evaluation set containing few-and-zero-shot examples of a wide variety of senses . The authors establish baselines on the new dataset with knowledge-based and neural WSD approaches and present transfer learning experiments demonstrating that models additionally trained with the dataset better capture rare senses in existing WSD datasets . Finally , the authors find that humans outperform the best baseline models on the dataset . Overall , the paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the dataset is limited . It is a collection of sentences extracted from Wikipedia . 2 .The authors claim that the dataset provides high coverage of many diverse words in a low shot manner , however , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , in Table 1 , the number of rare senses is not reported . 3 .In Table 2 , the performance of the biencoder is not compared with human annotators . 4 .The evaluation set is not well-defined . For instance , how many senses are used in the evaluation set ? 5 .It is unclear to me why the authors did not compare with the SemCor dataset , which is the current de facto benchmark for modeling English WSD .
1_1812.02425 = This paper proposes a method for compressing large , complex trained ensembles into a single network , where knowledge from a variety of trained deep neural networks ( DNNs ) is distilled and transferred to a single DNN . In order to distill diverse knowledge from different trained ( teacher ) models , the authors propose to use adversarial-based learning strategy where we define a block-wise training loss to guide and optimize the predefined student network to recover the knowledge in teacher models , and to promote the discriminator network to distinguish teacher vs. student features simultaneously . Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 , SVHN and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MEAL method . The proposed ensemble method ( MEAL ) of transferring distilled knowledge with adversarial learning exhibits three important advantages : ( 1 ) the student network that learns the distilled knowledge by discriminators is optimized better than the original model ; ( 2 ) fast inference is realized by a single forward pass , while the performance is even better than traditional ensemble from multi-original models ; ( 3 ) student network can learn the distilled Knowledge from a teacher model that has arbitrary structures . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . The idea of distilling knowledge from trained neural networks and transferring it to another new network has been well explored in ( Hinton , Vinyals , and Dean 2015 ; Chen , Goodfellow , and Shlens 2016 ; Li et al.2017 ; Yim et al .2017 ; Bagherinezhad , 2018 ; Anil , 2018 ) . 2 .The experiments are not convincing enough . In Table 1 , the performance of ResNet-50 based MEAL achieves top1/5 21.79 %/5.99 % val error , which outperforms the original models by 2.06 %/1.14 % .
1_1901.06829 = This paper proposes a reinforcement learning based framework for the task of video grounding , which aims to temporally localize a natural language description in a video . To alleviate this problem , the authors formulate this task as a problem of sequential decision making by learning an agent which regulates the temporal grounding boundaries progressively based on its policy . The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ActivityNet ’ 18 DenseCaption dataset and Charades-STA dataset while observing only 10 or less clips per video . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . The main contribution of this paper is the multi-task learning with reinforcement learning in a multi task learning framework , which helps the agent obtain more accurate information about the environment and better explore the state space to encounter more reward , thus it can act more effectively towards task accom- plishment . 2 .The experimental results are not convincing . The performance of this method is not better than other baselines . For example , the performance of the baselines are not comparable with the proposed methods . 3 .The proposed method can not be compared with other related methods , such as the following : [ 1 ] https : //arxiv.org/abs/1711.05822 [ 2 ] http : //proceedings.mlr.press/v48/jmlr2017/papers/JMLR17/papers.pdf [ 3 ] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pii/S1411.0390624 ( 2017 ) [ 4 ] http: //www.cs.cmu.edu.edu/~davies/research.html
1_1909.07557 = This paper studies the Housing Market problem , where each agent can only receive a single object and has preferences over all objects . The authors consider whether an object is reachable for a given agent under a social network , where a trade between two agents is allowed if they are neighbors in the network and no participant has a deficit from the trade . Assume that the preferences of the agents are strict ( no tie among objects is allowed ) . This problem is polynomial-time solvable in a starnetwork and NP-complete in a tree-network . It is left as an open problem whether the problem can be solved in polynomially time when the network is a path or a star . The paper shows that when the preferences are weak ( no ties among objects are allowed ) , the problem becomes NP-hard . Then , the authors show that the problem is solvable when the networks is path or star . This paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main idea of this paper is to study the problem of finding the optimal assignment for an agent in the housing market problem . But , it is not clear to me how to solve the problem in the social network setting . 2 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , in Section 2.3.1 , the definition of Pareto Efficiency is not clearly explained . 3 .In Section 3.2 , the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 are not clear . 4 .In Theorem 4 , the algorithm is not explained clearly . 5 .Theorem 4.1 is not proved clearly .
1_2012.04715 = In this paper , the authors attempt to solve the long-standing problem of finding a projective plane of order 10 from projective geometry by translating the problem into Boolean logic and using satisfiability ( SAT ) solvers to produce nonexistence certificates that can be verified by a third party . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of the paper is to use SAT solvers instead of special-purpose search code to perform the search . However , I have some concerns about the novelty of the proposed method . First , the proposed SAT solver is based on the cube-and-conquer method . It is not clear to me why the authors chose to use the Cubing solver instead of the more popular SAC solver . The Cubing method is known to be more error-prone than the SAC method . The authors should compare their method with the Cubed-Conquer method in order to show the advantage of their method . Second , I am not convinced about the correctness of the verification method . For example , in the proof of the certificate , the paper claims that the authors verified that the certificate is consistent with the original search code , but the verification is not correct . I think the authors should provide more details about the verification procedure .
1_1810.00826 = This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks ( GNNs ) to represent different graph structures . The main contribution of this paper is to analyze the discriminative power of popular GNN variants , such as Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN ) and GraphSAGE , and show that they can not learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures such as subtrees . The authors then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNN and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns about this paper . 1 .Theoretical results are based on the assumption that the graph is a set of multisets of bounded size , which is not true in practice . For example , in the proof of Lemma 3.1 , the authors assume that the embedding of a multiset is unique for each pair ( c , X ) , but in practice , the embeddings of c and X are not unique . 2 .Theorem 3.2 shows that the representation of a GNN does not satisfy the conditions in Theorem 3 . Theorem 4 shows that GNN with mean aggregators are not expressive , but it is not clear why this is the case . 3 .In the experiments , the performance of the proposed method is not better than the state-of-the-art methods . It would be better if the authors can compare the performance with other GNN methods such as GCN and GraphSage . 4 .The experimental results are not convincing . The proposed method does not outperform the other methods .

The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of the paper is to use SAT solver to solve the projective plane of order 10 problem . The authors also show that the consistency issues in the original search and the independent verification in 2011 are due to the use of special-purpose search code . However , these searches were each performed using highly specialized custom-written code and did not produce a nonexistence certificate . This paper shows that using well-tested SAT solvers is less error-prone than writing special purpose search code , which is a reality of developing software for computer-assisted proofs is that it is extremely difficult to make custom-writing code both correct and efficient .

1_2102.07983 = This paper introduces a new low-shot WSD dataset , FEWS ( Few-shot Examples of Word Senses ) , a new dataset automatically extracted from example sentences in Wiktionary . The dataset has high sense coverage across different natural language domains and provides : ( 1 ) a large training set that covers many more senses than previous datasets and ( 2 ) a comprehensive evaluation set containing few-and-zero-shot examples of a wide variety of senses . The authors establish baselines on the new dataset with knowledge-based and neural WSD approaches and present transfer learning experiments demonstrating that models additionally trained with the dataset better capture rare senses in existing WSD datasets . Finally , the authors find that humans outperform the best baseline models on the dataset . Overall , the paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the dataset is limited . It is a collection of sentences extracted from Wikipedia . 2 .The authors claim that the dataset provides high coverage of many diverse words in a low shot manner , however , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , in Table 1 , the number of rare senses is not reported . 3 .In Table 2 , the performance of the biencoder is not compared with human annotators . 4 .The evaluation set is not well-defined . For instance , how many senses are used in the evaluation set ? 5 .It is unclear to me why the authors did not compare with the SemCor dataset , which is the current de facto benchmark for modeling English WSD .
1_1812.02425 = This paper proposes a method for compressing large , complex trained ensembles into a single network , where knowledge from a variety of trained deep neural networks ( DNNs ) is distilled and transferred to a single DNN . In order to distill diverse knowledge from different trained ( teacher ) models , the authors propose to use adversarial-based learning strategy where we define a block-wise training loss to guide and optimize the predefined student network to recover the knowledge in teacher models , and to promote the discriminator network to distinguish teacher vs. student features simultaneously . Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 , SVHN and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MEAL method . The proposed ensemble method ( MEAL ) of transferring distilled knowledge with adversarial learning exhibits three important advantages : ( 1 ) the student network that learns the distilled knowledge by discriminators is optimized better than the original model ; ( 2 ) fast inference is realized by a single forward pass , while the performance is even better than traditional ensemble from multi-original models ; ( 3 ) student network can learn the distilled Knowledge from a teacher model that has arbitrary structures . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . The idea of distilling knowledge from trained neural networks and transferring it to another new network has been well explored in ( Hinton , Vinyals , and Dean 2015 ; Chen , Goodfellow , and Shlens 2016 ; Li et al.2017 ; Yim et al .2017 ; Bagherinezhad , 2018 ; Anil , 2018 ) . 2 .The experiments are not convincing enough . In Table 1 , the performance of ResNet-50 based MEAL achieves top1/5 21.79 %/5.99 % val error , which outperforms the original models by 2.06 %/1.14 % .
1_1901.06829 = This paper proposes a novel approach to the task of video grounding , which aims to temporally localize a natural language description in a video . The authors formulate this task as a problem of sequential decision making by learning an agent which regulates the temporal grounding boundaries progressively based on its policy . Specifically , they propose a reinforcement learning based framework improved by multi-task learning and it shows steady performance gains by considering additional supervised boundary information during training . The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ActivityNet ’ 18 DenseCaption dataset ( Krishna et al. 2017 ) and Charades-STA dataset ( Sigurdsson et al .2016 ) while observing only 10 or less clips per video . Pros : 1 . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . 2 .The proposed approach is novel in that it successfully combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning in a multi task learning framework , which helps the agent obtain more accurate information about the environment and better explore the state space to encounter more reward , thus it can act more effectively towards task accom- plishment . 3 .The paper is technically sound . Cons : 1.1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . 2.2 .The experimental results are not convincing .
1_1909.07557 = This paper studies the Housing Market problem , where each agent can only receive a single object and has preferences over all objects . The authors consider whether an object is reachable for a given agent under a social network , where a trade between two agents is allowed if they are neighbors in the network and no participant has a deficit from the trade . Assume that the preferences of the agents are strict ( no tie among objects is allowed ) . This problem is polynomial-time solvable in a starnetwork and NP-complete in a tree-network . It is left as an open problem whether the problem can be solved in polynomially time when the network is a path or a star . The paper shows that when the preferences are weak ( no ties among objects are allowed ) , the problem becomes NP-hard . Then , the authors show that the problem is solvable when the networks is path or star . This paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main idea of this paper is to study the problem of finding the optimal assignment for an agent in the housing market problem . But , it is not clear to me how to solve the problem in the social network setting . 2 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , in Section 2.3.1 , the definition of Pareto Efficiency is not clearly explained . 3 .In Section 3.2 , the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 are not clear . 4 .In Theorem 4 , the algorithm is not explained clearly . 5 .Theorem 4.1 is not proved clearly .
1_2012.04715 = In this paper , the authors attempt to solve Lam 's problem from projective geometry by translating the problem into Boolean logic and using satisfiability ( SAT ) solvers to produce nonexistence certificates that can be verified by a third party . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of the paper is to use SAT solver to solve the projective plane of order 10 problem . The authors also show that the consistency issues in the original search and the independent verification in 2011 are due to the use of special-purpose search code . However , these searches were each performed using highly specialized custom-written code and did not produce a nonexistence certificate . This paper shows that using well-tested SAT solvers is less error-prone than writing special purpose search code , which is a reality of developing software for computer-assisted proofs is that it is extremely difficult to make custom-writing code both correct and efficient .
1_1810.00826 = This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks ( GNNs ) in the context of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test . In particular , the paper shows that the most powerful GNN , Graph Isomorphism Network ( GIN ) , has high representational power as it almost perfectly fits the training data , whereas GNN variants often severely underfit the data . The paper then proposes a simple architecture , GraphSAGE , that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNN . The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of graph classification tasks . The main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for analyzing GNN ’ s expressive power to capture different graph structures . However , I have the following concerns about this paper . 1 .The paper claims that GNN can represent injective multiset functions , however , it is not clear to me how to interpret this statement . For example , in Eq . ( 5.1 ) , the authors claim that h ( c , X ) = ( 1 + ) + f ( c ) + \sum_ { x } _ { f ( x ) } is unique for each pair ( c,X ) , where c and X are multisets of bounded size . But in the proof of Theorem 3.1 , it seems to me that for infinitely many choices of f , including all irrational numbers , the function f is not unique . 2 .In the experimental results , the performance of the proposed GIN is not better than other GNN models . In Table 1 , the results of GCN ( Hamilton et al. , 2017 ) is better than the proposed one . It is not convincing to me why the proposed method is superior to GCN . 3 .In Table 2 , the result of GIN with 1-layer perceptrons are better than GCN with 2-layer in terms of classification accuracy . It seems that GCN has better classification accuracy than GIN . It would be better if the authors can provide more explanation about this result . 4 .In Section 5.2 , the author claimed that GIN can not learn to distinguish simple graph structures , which is not true . The authors should provide more explanations about this claim .
1_1907.07355 = This paper studies the effect of spurious statistical cues on BERT 's performance on the argument reasoning comprehension task . The authors show that a range of models all exploit these cues , and propose an adversarial dataset on which all models achieve random accuracy . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of this paper is to show that the BERT performance is entirely accounted for by exploitation of spurious statistics in the dataset . This is an interesting result . However , I have some concerns about this paper . 1 .The authors claim that BERT ’ s performance is only three points below the average untrained human baseline , which is surprising . It is not clear to me how this result can be explained by the spurious statistics . 2 .In the experiments , the authors only consider unigrams and bigrams , although more sophisticated cues may be present . It would be interesting to see the results of more complex cues , such as bigrams . 3 .In Table 1 , it would be better if the authors can report the mean and median performance of BERT . 4 .In Figure 1 , the error bars are too small . It will be better to show the average error bars . 5 .In Section 3.2 , it is unclear to me why the authors did not include the results in Table 1 .
1_1904.11943 = This paper proposes SWALP , an approach to low precision training that averages low-precision SGD iterates with a modified learning rate schedule . The proposed method is easy to implement and can match the performance of full precision SGD even with all numbers quantized down to 8 bits , including the gradient accumulators . The paper is well written and easy to follow . The experimental results are convincing and show that the proposed method converges arbitrarily close to the optimal solution for quadratic objectives , and to a noise ball asymptotically smaller than low Precision SGD in strongly convex settings .
1_1902.04911 = This paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for dialogue generation that uses both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge to facilitate knowledge selection . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The idea of using the posterior distribution over knowledge is interesting and novel . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . In the prior knowledge module , the prior distribution p ( k|x ) is inferred from both the utterance and the response , while the posterior p ( y|x , y ) is only inferred from the responses . It is not clear to me how the prior p ( x ) can be used to select appropriate knowledge . 2 .In the inference process , the authors use the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss ( KLDivLoss ) to measure the distance between the prior and the posterior distributions . It seems that the authors do not use the KL divergence between the posterior and the prior . 3 .The authors should compare the performance of the proposed model with the baselines on the Persona dataset and Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset . 4 .The proposed model is not compared with the baseline methods in the literature .
1_2005.06628 = This paper proposes a pruning-based approach to reduce the number of parameters in the BERT language model . The main idea is to prune the architecture of the encoder and the attention head of the Transformer . The pruning is done by optimizing the architecture design dimensions of each layer of the model , and the pruned parameters are then used to train the model in a pre-trained fashion . The authors show that the proposed method can achieve 6.6 % higher average accuracy on GLUE and SQuAD datasets as compared to BERT with three encoder layers while having the same number parameters . Pros : 1 . The paper is well written and easy to follow . 2 .The idea of pruning the model is interesting . 3 .The proposed pruning method is simple and effective . Cons : 1.1 .

It would be better if the authors can provide more explanation on this point . 3 .In Table 1 , it is unclear to me what is the performance of the biencoder model on the zero shot senses . Is it the same as the baseline model ? 4 .The evaluation set is not very comprehensive . It seems that the authors did not compare with the SemCor dataset , which contains 761 unique zero-shots and 761 few-shots senses . It will be better to provide more details on the evaluation set . 5 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , the abstract and introduction should be moved to the main paper . 6 .The experiments are not convincing . The results are not compared with the state-of-the-art .

1_1902.04911 = This paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for dialogue generation with knowledge-grounded responses . The authors propose a knowledge selection mechanism where both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge are used to facilitate knowledge selection . Experiments on both automatic and human evaluation verify the superiority of the proposed model over previous baselines . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns . 1 .The authors claim that their model is the first neural model which incorporates the posterior distribution as guidance , enabling accurate knowledge lookups and high quality response generation . But , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , the prior distribution p ( k|x ) is inferred from both utterances and responses , and it ensures the appropriate selection of knowledge during the training process . Meanwhile , a prior distribution is inferred only from utterances only , so that appropriate knowledge can be selected even without responses during the inference process . Compared with the previous work , our model can better incorporate appropriate knowledge in response generation , which is better than previous work . 2 .In Table 1 , the authors compare the performance of their model with Seq2Seq model with a GRU decoder where knowledge is concatenated .

1_2012.04715 = In this paper , the authors attempt to solve Lam 's problem from projective geometry by translating the problem into Boolean logic and using satisfiability ( SAT ) solvers to produce nonexistence certificates that can be verified by a third party . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of the paper is to use SAT solver to solve the projective plane of order 10 problem . The authors also show that the consistency issues in the original search and the independent verification in 2011 are due to the use of special-purpose search code . However , these searches were each performed using highly specialized custom-written code and did not produce a nonexistence certificate . This paper shows that using well-tested SAT solvers is less error-prone than writing special purpose search code , which is a reality of developing software for computer-assisted proofs is that it is extremely difficult to make custom-writing code both correct and efficient .
1_1810.00826 = This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks ( GNNs ) in the context of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test . In particular , the paper shows that the most powerful GNN , Graph Isomorphism Network ( GIN ) , has high representational power as it almost perfectly fits the training data , whereas GNN variants often severely underfit the data . The paper then proposes a simple architecture , GraphSAGE , that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNN . The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of graph classification tasks . The main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for analyzing GNN ’ s expressive power to capture different graph structures . However , I have the following concerns about this paper . 1 .The paper claims that GNN can represent injective multiset functions , however , it is not clear to me how to interpret this statement . For example , in Eq . ( 5.1 ) , the authors claim that h ( c , X ) = ( 1 + ) + f ( c ) + \sum_ { x } _ { f ( x ) } is unique for each pair ( c,X ) , where c and X are multisets of bounded size . But in the proof of Theorem 3.1 , it seems to me that for infinitely many choices of f , including all irrational numbers , the function f is not unique . 2 .In the experimental results , the performance of the proposed GIN is not better than other GNN models . In Table 1 , the results of GCN ( Hamilton et al. , 2017 ) is better than the proposed one . It is not convincing to me why the proposed method is superior to GCN . 3 .In Table 2 , the result of GIN with 1-layer perceptrons are better than GCN with 2-layer in terms of classification accuracy . It seems that GCN has better classification accuracy than GIN . It would be better if the authors can provide more explanation about this result . 4 .In Section 5.2 , the author claimed that GIN can not learn to distinguish simple graph structures , which is not true . The authors should provide more explanations about this claim .
1_1907.07355 = This paper studies the effect of spurious statistical cues on BERT 's performance on the argument reasoning comprehension task . The authors show that a range of models all exploit these cues , and propose an adversarial dataset on which all models achieve random accuracy . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of this paper is to show that the BERT performance is entirely accounted for by exploitation of spurious statistics in the dataset . This is an interesting result . However , I have some concerns about this paper . 1 .The authors claim that BERT ’ s performance is only three points below the average untrained human baseline , which is surprising . It is not clear to me how this result can be explained by the spurious statistics . 2 .In the experiments , the authors only consider unigrams and bigrams , although more sophisticated cues may be present . It would be interesting to see the results of more complex cues , such as bigrams . 3 .In Table 1 , it would be better if the authors can report the mean and median performance of BERT . 4 .In Figure 1 , the error bars are too small . It will be better to show the average error bars . 5 .In Section 3.2 , it is unclear to me why the authors did not include the results in Table 1 .
1_1904.11943 = This paper proposes SWALP , an approach to low precision training that averages low-precision SGD iterates with a modified learning rate schedule . The proposed method is easy to implement and can match the performance of full precision SGD even with all numbers quantized down to 8 bits , including the gradient accumulators . The paper is well written and easy to follow . The experimental results are convincing and show that the proposed method converges arbitrarily close to the optimal solution for quadratic objectives , and to a noise ball asymptotically smaller than low Precision SGD in strongly convex settings .
1_1902.04911 = This paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for dialogue generation with knowledge-grounded responses . The authors propose a knowledge selection mechanism where both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge are used to facilitate knowledge selection . Experiments on both automatic and human evaluation verify the superiority of the proposed model over previous baselines . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns . 1 .The authors claim that their model is the first neural model which incorporates the posterior distribution as guidance , enabling accurate knowledge lookups and high quality response generation . But , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , the prior distribution p ( k|x ) is inferred from both utterances and responses , and it ensures the appropriate selection of knowledge during the training process . Meanwhile , a prior distribution is inferred only from utterances only , so that appropriate knowledge can be selected even without responses during the inference process . Compared with the previous work , our model can better incorporate appropriate knowledge in response generation , which is better than previous work . 2 .In Table 1 , the authors compare the performance of their model with Seq2Seq model with a GRU decoder where knowledge is concatenated . It would be better if the authors can show the results of different ways of incorporating knowledge incorporating knowledge . 3 .It is better to show the effect of different loss functions in Table 1 .
1_2005.06628 = This paper proposes a pruning-based approach to reduce the number of parameters in the BERT language model . The main idea is to prune the architecture of the encoder and the attention head of the Transformer . The pruning is done by optimizing the architecture design dimensions of each layer of the model , and the pruned parameters are then used to train the model in a pre-trained fashion . The authors show that the proposed method can achieve 6.6 % higher average accuracy on GLUE and SQuAD datasets as compared to BERT with three encoder layers while having the same number parameters . Pros : 1 . The paper is well written and easy to follow . 2 .The idea of pruning the model is interesting . 3 .The proposed pruning method is simple and effective . Cons : 1.1 . It is not clear why the authors chose to optimize the design dimensions in the pruning framework rather than launching a pretraining job for each of these choices . 2.2 .The authors should compare the performance of the proposed pruned model with other pruning methods such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT . 3.3 .The experiments are only conducted on one language modeling task ( GLUE ) . It would be better if the authors can conduct more experiments on other language modeling tasks such as NLP tasks .
1_2102.07983 = This paper introduces a new low-shot WSD dataset , FEWS ( Few-shot Examples of Word Senses ) , a new dataset automatically extracted from example sentences in Wiktionary . The dataset has high sense coverage across different natural language domains and provides : ( 1 ) a large training set that covers many more senses than previous datasets and ( 2 ) a comprehensive evaluation set containing few-and-zero-shot examples of a wide variety of senses . The authors establish baselines on the new dataset with knowledge-based and neural WSD approaches and present transfer learning experiments demonstrating that models additionally trained with the dataset better capture rare senses in existing WSD datasets . Finally , the authors find that humans outperform the best baseline models on the dataset . Overall , the paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the dataset is limited . It is a collection of sentences extracted from Wikipedia . 2 .The authors claim that the dataset provides high coverage of many diverse words in a low shot manner , however , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , in Table 1 , the number of rare senses is not reported . 3 .In Table 2 , the performance of the biencoder is not compared with human annotators . 4 .The evaluation set is not well-defined . For instance , how many senses are used in the evaluation set ? 5 .It is unclear to me why the authors did not compare with the SemCor dataset , which is the current de facto benchmark for modeling English WSD .
1_1812.02425 = This paper proposes a method for compressing large , complex trained ensembles into a single network , where knowledge from a variety of trained deep neural networks ( DNNs ) is distilled and transferred to a single DNN . In order to distill diverse knowledge from different trained ( teacher ) models , the authors propose to use adversarial-based learning strategy where we define a block-wise training loss to guide and optimize the predefined student network to recover the knowledge in teacher models , and to promote the discriminator network to distinguish teacher vs. student features simultaneously . Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 , SVHN and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MEAL method . The proposed ensemble method ( MEAL ) of transferring distilled knowledge with adversarial learning exhibits three important advantages : ( 1 ) the student network that learns the distilled knowledge by discriminators is optimized better than the original model ; ( 2 ) fast inference is realized by a single forward pass , while the performance is even better than traditional ensemble from multi-original models ; ( 3 ) student network can learn the distilled Knowledge from a teacher model that has arbitrary structures . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . The idea of distilling knowledge from trained neural networks and transferring it to another new network has been well explored in ( Hinton , Vinyals , and Dean 2015 ; Chen , Goodfellow , and Shlens 2016 ; Li et al.2017 ; Yim et al .2017 ; Bagherinezhad , 2018 ; Anil , 2018 ) . 2 .The experiments are not convincing enough . In Table 1 , the performance of ResNet-50 based MEAL achieves top1/5 21.79 %/5.99 % val error , which outperforms the original models by 2.06 %/1.14 % .
1_1901.06829 = This paper proposes a novel approach to the task of video grounding , which aims to temporally localize a natural language description in a video . The authors formulate this task as a problem of sequential decision making by learning an agent which regulates the temporal grounding boundaries progressively based on its policy . Specifically , they propose a reinforcement learning based framework improved by multi-task learning and it shows steady performance gains by considering additional supervised boundary information during training . The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ActivityNet ’ 18 DenseCaption dataset ( Krishna et al. 2017 ) and Charades-STA dataset ( Sigurdsson et al .2016 ) while observing only 10 or less clips per video . Pros : 1 . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . 2 .The proposed approach is novel in that it successfully combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning in a multi task learning framework , which helps the agent obtain more accurate information about the environment and better explore the state space to encounter more reward , thus it can act more effectively towards task accom- plishment . 3 .The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines . Cons : 1.1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . 2.2 .The experimental results are not convincing .
1_1909.07557 = This paper studies the Housing Market problem , where each agent can only receive a single object and has preferences over all objects . The authors consider whether an object is reachable for a given agent under a social network , where a trade between two agents is allowed if they are neighbors in the network and no participant has a deficit from the trade . Assume that the preferences of the agents are strict ( no tie among objects is allowed ) . This problem is polynomial-time solvable in a starnetwork and NP-complete in a tree-network . It is left as an open problem whether the problem can be solved in polynomially time when the network is a path or a star . The paper shows that when the preferences are weak ( no ties among objects are allowed ) , the problem becomes NP-hard . Then , the authors show that the problem is solvable when the networks is path or star . This paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main idea of this paper is to study the problem of finding the optimal assignment for an agent in the housing market problem . But , it is not clear to me how to solve the problem in the social network setting . 2 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , in Section 2.3.1 , the definition of Pareto Efficiency is not clearly explained . 3 .In Section 3.2 , the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 are not clear . 4 .In Theorem 4 , the algorithm is not explained clearly . 5 .Theorem 4.1 is not proved clearly .

This is because GCN can not learn to distinguish simple graph structures such as subtrees .

The main contribution of the paper is to show that BERT ’ s performance is entirely accounted for by exploitation of spurious statistics in the dataset . This is an interesting result . However , I have the following concerns about the paper . 1 .The authors claim that “ without supplying the required world knowledge for this task it does not seem reasonable to expect it to perform so well ” . I am not sure if this statement is true . In fact , BERT is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ARCT task by exploiting the spurious statistics , and it is not surprising that it can do so . 2 .The paper is not well-motivated . In the introduction , the authors claim “ This is a challenging task for machine learners , as it can be hard even for humans to determine when two text segments stand in argumentative relation , as evidenced by studies on argument annotation ( Habernal et al. , 2014 ) . ” However , there is no evidence to support this claim . For example , in Table 1 , it is shown that human performance is only 3 points below the average untrained human baseline . It is not clear to me why BERT can achieve such a high performance on ARCT . 3 .In Table 2 , it seems that the authors only report the mean and median of the BERT performance . It would be better if the authors can report the average performance of all models . 4 .In the experiments , it would be interesting to see how BERT performs when the model is not trained properly . For instance , how does BERT perform when BERT fails to train properly ?

1_2102.07983 = This paper introduces a new low-shot WSD dataset , FEWS ( Few-shot Examples of Word Senses ) , a new dataset automatically extracted from example sentences in Wiktionary . The dataset has high sense coverage across different natural language domains and provides : ( 1 ) a large training set that covers many more senses than previous datasets and ( 2 ) a comprehensive evaluation set containing few-and-zero-shot examples of a wide variety of senses . The authors establish baselines on the new dataset with knowledge-based and neural WSD approaches and present transfer learning experiments demonstrating that models additionally trained with the dataset better capture rare senses in existing WSD datasets . Finally , the authors find that humans outperform the best baseline models on the dataset . Overall , the paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the dataset is limited . It is a collection of sentences extracted from Wikipedia . 2 .The authors claim that the dataset provides high coverage of many diverse words in a low shot manner , however , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , in Table 1 , the number of rare senses is not reported . 3 .In Table 2 , the performance of the biencoder is not compared with human annotators . 4 .The evaluation set is not well-defined .

1_1812.02425 = This paper proposes a method for compressing large , complex trained ensembles into a single network , where knowledge from a variety of trained deep neural networks ( DNNs ) is distilled and transferred to a single DNN . In order to distill diverse knowledge from different trained ( teacher ) models , the authors propose to use adversarial-based learning strategy where we define a block-wise training loss to guide and optimize the predefined student network to recover the knowledge in teacher models , and to promote the discriminator network to distinguish teacher vs. student features simultaneously . Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 , SVHN and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MEAL method . The proposed ensemble method ( MEAL ) of transferring distilled knowledge with adversarial learning exhibits three important advantages : ( 1 ) the student network that learns the distilled knowledge by discriminators is optimized better than the original model ; ( 2 ) fast inference is realized by a single forward pass , while the performance is even better than traditional ensemble from multi-original models ; ( 3 ) student network can learn the distilled Knowledge from a teacher model that has arbitrary structures . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The novelty of the proposed method is limited . The idea of distilling knowledge from trained neural networks and transferring it to another new network has been well explored in ( Hinton , Vinyals , and Dean 2015 ; Chen , Goodfellow , and Shlens 2016 ; Li et al.2017 ; Yim et al .2017 ; Bagherinezhad , 2018 ; Anil , 2018 ) . 2 .The experiments are not convincing enough . In Table 1 , the performance of ResNet-50 based MEAL achieves top1/5 21.79 %/5.99 % val error , which outperforms the original models by 2.06 %/1.14 % .
1_1901.06829 = This paper proposes a novel approach to the task of video grounding , which aims to temporally localize a natural language description in a video . The authors formulate this task as a problem of sequential decision making by learning an agent which regulates the temporal grounding boundaries progressively based on its policy . Specifically , they propose a reinforcement learning based framework improved by multi-task learning and it shows steady performance gains by considering additional supervised boundary information during training .

Pros : 1 . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . 2 .The proposed approach is novel in that it successfully combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning in a multi task learning framework , which helps the agent obtain more accurate information about the environment and better explore the state space to encounter more reward , thus it can act more effectively towards task accom- plishment . 3 .The paper is technically sound .

1_1909.07557 = This paper studies the Housing Market problem , where each agent can only receive a single object and has preferences over all objects . The authors consider whether an object is reachable for a given agent under a social network , where a trade between two agents is allowed if they are neighbors in the network and no participant has a deficit from the trade . Assume that the preferences of the agents are strict ( no tie among objects is allowed ) . This problem is polynomial-time solvable in a starnetwork and NP-complete in a tree-network . It is left as an open problem whether the problem can be solved in polynomially time when the network is a path or a star . The paper shows that when the preferences are weak ( no ties among objects are allowed ) , the problem becomes NP-hard . Then , the authors show that the problem is solvable when the networks is path or star . This paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main idea of this paper is to study the problem of finding the optimal assignment for an agent in the housing market problem . But , it is not clear to me how to solve the problem in the social network setting . 2 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , in Section 2.3.1 , the definition of Pareto Efficiency is not clearly explained . 3 .In Section 3.2 , the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 are not clear . 4 .In Theorem 4 , the algorithm is not explained clearly . 5 .Theorem 4.1 is not proved clearly .
1_2012.04715 = In this paper , the authors attempt to solve Lam 's problem from projective geometry by translating the problem into Boolean logic and using satisfiability ( SAT ) solvers to produce nonexistence certificates that can be verified by a third party . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . The main contribution of the paper is to use SAT solver to solve the projective plane of order 10 problem . The authors also show that the consistency issues in the original search and the independent verification in 2011 are due to the use of special-purpose search code . However , these searches were each performed using highly specialized custom-written code and did not produce a nonexistence certificate . This paper shows that using well-tested SAT solvers is less error-prone than writing special purpose search code , which is a reality of developing software for computer-assisted proofs is that it is extremely difficult to make custom-writing code both correct and efficient .
1_1810.00826 = This paper studies the expressive power of graph neural networks ( GNNs ) in the context of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test . In particular , the paper shows that the most powerful GNN , Graph Isomorphism Network ( GIN ) , has high representational power as it almost perfectly fits the training data , whereas GNN variants often severely underfit the data . The paper then proposes a simple architecture , GraphSAGE , that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNN . The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of graph classification tasks . The main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for analyzing GNN ’ s expressive power and show that they can not learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures .
1_1907.07355 = This paper investigates the role of spurious statistical cues in BERT 's performance on the argument reasoning comprehension task . The authors show that a range of models all exploit these cues , and propose to construct an adversarial dataset on which all models achieve random accuracy . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main contribution of this paper is to show that the performance of BERT is entirely accounted for by exploitation of spurious statistics in the dataset . This is an interesting finding , but it is not surprising that BERT performs so well on this task . 2 .The authors claim that this result is due to BERT ’ s ability to exploit the spurious statistics , but they do not provide any evidence to support this claim . 3 .It is not clear to me how to interpret the results in Table 1 . It seems that the BERT performance is only three points below the human baseline . It would be interesting to see how this result can be explained . 4 .In Table 1 , it seems that there is a gap between the mean and median performance of the models . Is it possible to explain this gap ? If so , it would be better to provide more details .
1_1904.11943 = This paper proposes SWALP , an approach to low precision training that averages low-precision SGD iterates with a modified learning rate schedule . The proposed method is simple and easy to implement and can match the performance of full precision SGD even with all numbers quantized down to 8 bits , including the gradient accumulators . The authors also show that SWA converges arbitrarily close to the optimal solution for quadratic objectives and to a noise ball asymptotically smaller than low precision SGd in strongly convex settings . The paper is well-written and the idea is interesting . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . In the experiments , it is not clear why SWA and HALP are compared in Table 1 . It would be better if the authors can show the results of HALP and SWA in the same table . 2 .In Table 1 , the authors only compare SWA with SGD with a fixed learning rate . It is better to compare with other methods such as QSGD or HALP . 3 .In the experiment , it would be more convincing if the author can show results with different learning rate schedules .
1_1902.04911 = This paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for dialogue generation with knowledge-grounded responses . The authors propose a knowledge selection mechanism where both prior and posterior distributions over knowledge are used to facilitate knowledge selection . Experiments on both automatic and human evaluation verify the superiority of the proposed model over previous baselines . The paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns . 1 .The authors claim that their model is the first neural model which incorporates the posterior distribution as guidance , enabling accurate knowledge lookups and high quality response generation . But , it is not clear to me how this is achieved . For example , the prior distribution p ( k|x ) is inferred from both utterances and responses , and it ensures the appropriate selection of knowledge during the training process . Meanwhile , a prior distribution is inferred only from utterances only , so that appropriate knowledge can be selected even without responses during the inference process . Compared with the previous work , our model can better incorporate appropriate knowledge in response generation , which is better than previous work . 2 .In Table 1 , the authors compare the performance of their model with Seq2Seq model with a GRU decoder where knowledge is concatenated . It would be better if the authors can show the results of different ways of incorporating knowledge incorporating knowledge . 3 .It is better to show the effect of different loss functions in Table 1 .
1_2005.06628 = This paper proposes a pruning approach to reduce the number of parameters in the BERT model . The main idea is to prune the parameters of each layer of the model by 5 different dimensions , and then pre-train multiple variants of BERT with different values chosen for these dimensions by applying pruning-based architecture search technique . Experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that the proposed method achieves 6.6 % higher average accuracy compared to BERT without three encoder layers while having the same number parameters . Pros : 1 . The paper is well written and easy to follow . 2 .The idea of pruning the model parameters is interesting . 3 .The proposed method is simple and effective . 4 .The experimental results are convincing . Cons : 1 ) It is not clear to me why the proposed pruning method is better than other pruning methods such as RoBERTa ( Liu et al. , 2019 ) and DistilBERT ( Sanh et al .2019 ) . 2 ) The proposed method can be applied to other objectives such as FLOPs or latency . 3 ) The experiments are limited to GLUE dataset .

Assume that the preferences of the agents are strict ( no tie among objects is allowed ) . This problem is polynomial-time solvable in a starnetwork and NP-complete in a tree-network . It is left as an open problem whether the problem can be solved in polynomially time when the network is a path or a star . The paper shows that when the preferences are weak ( no ties among objects are allowed ) , the problem becomes NP-hard . Then , the authors show that the problem is solvable when the networks is path or star . This paper is well-written and easy to follow . However , I have the following concerns : 1 . The main idea of this paper is to study the problem of finding the optimal assignment for an agent in the housing market problem . But , it is not clear to me how to solve the problem in the social network setting . 2 .The paper is not well-organized . For example , in Section 2.3.1 , the definition of Pareto Efficiency is not clearly explained . 3 .In Section 3.2 , the proof of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 3.1 are not clear . 4 .In Theorem 4 , the algorithm is not explained clearly . 5 .Theorem 4.1 is not proved clearly .
